				<h2>What was your <span class="c">experience during the event</span>?</h2>
				<div class="text">
					<p>The opening salvo of the Lux Mundis Cup was a blast!, especially with the speaker being extra 
						loud—I liked it a lot. After performing our Pagarbuhay presentation, the comments from our institute 
						were so pleasant that I felt all those late nights were worthwhile. It was an great experience, 
						especially with the bond we formed as Pagarbuhay participants.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						On the second day, we had our softball game. It was funny and quick, but I had a great time. 
						The remaining days were truly memorable, with people showcasing their talents and hard work through 
						spectacular performances. Overall, it was an amazing event—except for the last day, which I didn't 
						quite understand.</p>
